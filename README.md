This Project was created using Create-React-App (CRA). All normal script commands apply.

To view the application in your local environment, you will need to create an environment variable with your own GIPHY API KEY and name it REACT_APP_GIPHY. The current project references it in a .env file. Then, you can run 'npm start' in the command line. The project will open in localhost port 3000.
